American League,1975,1975 AMERICAN LEAGUE,"""A lot of things happened to me that year (1975) . It was new and it happened very fast.

American League,2008,2008 AMERICAN LEAGUE,"""Baseball never promises you a happy ending. In fact, it braces you for failure more than success, so that you fully appreciate the latter. There are 30 teams, and seven of those have advanced to the postseason; the Twins or White Sox loom as the eighth and last.

'So the connection to the past is very important.' To loosely quote the script, the memories could be so thick at this World Series, the fans will have to swat them away from their faces. The Cubs have gone 108 years without a championship. The Cleveland Indians have gone 68. No other team in baseball has come close to so many consecutive unfulfilled seasons. 'The baseball gods are really happy right now,' the Indians' Mike Napoli said. 'I wanted the Cubs to win, just because I knew how cool it would be to be a part of it.

They have a starting staff that is six deep, which enabled them to let Justin Verlander, the AL Cy Young Award winner, leave for the Mets -- simply because they don't really need him. The 'World Series hangover' likely won't apply this year, considering Houston played two games over the minimum in the postseason and had multiple days of rest between each round.

'So the connection to the past is very important.' To loosely quote the script, the memories could be so thick at this World Series, the fans will have to swat them away from their faces. The Cubs have gone 108 years without a championship. The Cleveland Indians have gone 68. No other team in baseball has come close to so many consecutive unfulfilled seasons.
